# Commit, Push, and Deploy After Fixes

After you make fixes or feature changes to this project:

1. **Commit** – Stage the changed files and create a clear, concise commit message describing the fix or change.
2. **Push** – Push the commit to the remote (e.g. `origin main`).
3. **Deploy** – Trigger a deployment (e.g. Vercel will auto-deploy on push; if not, run `npx vercel --prod` or the project’s deploy command).

Do not stop after editing files. Always complete these three steps unless the user explicitly asks not to commit, push, or deploy.
